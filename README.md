# minilibc

Recode of a few standard libc functions as a way to learn NASM

## Build

- Compile with `make`
- Test with `make tests && ./unit_tests.out`

## Footnote
As you'll see not all tests are passing, that's because, in those cases, I do not understand the behavior of the functions I tried to implement.
